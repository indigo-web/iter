# iter
Yet another iterating toolset.

# Why?
I faced the need of an iterating toolset in indigo. However, I failed to find any good solutions (the most popular one is empty-interfaces-based). That's why this package was created

# What is the difference with another packages?
I have no idea. This one is original, and was constructed according to my own taste

# How to use?
Just `go get github.com/indigo-web/iter`. Documentation is, unfortunately, not yet.
